# An easy add user script for Max OSX.
# Although I wrote this for 10.7 Lion Server, these commands have been the same since 10.5 Leopard.
# It's pretty simple as it uses and strings together the (rustic and ancient) commands that OSX
# already uses to add users.

# === Typically, this is all the info you need to enter ===

echo "Enter your desired user name: "
read USERNAME

echo "Enter a full name for this user: "
read FULLNAME

echo "Enter a password for this user: "

# A list of (secondary) groups the user should belong to
# This makes the difference between admin and non-admin users.

echo "Is this an administrative user? (y/n)"

    SECONDARY_GROUPS="staff"  # for a non-admin user
elif [ "$GROUP_ADD" = y ] ; then
    SECONDARY_GROUPS="admin _lpadmin _appserveradm _appserverusr" # for an admin user
else
    echo "You did not make a valid selection!"

# Create a UID that is not currently in use
echo "Creating an unused UID for new user..."

# by one in an obnoxious and time consuming way.
